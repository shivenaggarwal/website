              everyone's obsessed with "best practices" and "industry standards"
              but who decided these were best? some committee of people who were
              probably wrong about half the things they believed? we treat these
              guidelines like gospel when they're really just opinions that got
              popular.

              the whole education system is backwards. we spend years learning
              prerequisites for prerequisites, building foundations for
              buildings we might never construct. meanwhile, the kid who drops
              out and starts coding at 14 is shipping products that matter.

              i've been guilty of this too. spending months "preparing" to start
              a project instead of just starting. reading about machine learning

              without application means anything.

              . think about it, there are only 52 weeks in a year. how many do
              you spend talking about doing something instead of actually doing
              it?

            <p className="text-base">
              when you move fast, you hit reality constantly. you figure out
              what actually works instead of what sounds good in theory. the
              fluff disappears because there's no time for it.

              we've gotten so used to comfort that we can't handle even
              productive discomfort. the moment something feels hard, we retreat
              to "learning more" instead of just pushing through the confusion.
              but confusion is where the real learning happens.

              markets aren't nearly as smart as we pretend they are. if everyone
              was really processing information efficiently, you wouldn't have
              teenagers building billion-dollar companies that "experts" said
              would never work. the biggest wins happen where everyone else
              thinks there's nothing to see.

              should be instead of figuring out who they actually are. they
              optimize for external validation instead of internal satisfaction.
            </p>

            <p className="text-base">
              we've stopped asking what actually matters. what creates real
              value versus what just feels good in the moment? it's easier to
              follow someone else's script than to write your own.
